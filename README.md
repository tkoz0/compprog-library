# compprog-library

Named as a shortening of competitive programming library. Not really sure where
this will go but it is probably going to be a collection of standard data
structures and algorithms from which code snippets can be copied and pasted for
solving competitive programming problems.

# goals

- not really sure but some possibly dumb ideas are listed
- make it "almost as easy" to write C++ as it is to write Python for solving
programming problems (this goal is probably not realistic)
- provide useful code snippets to copy and paste for programming problems
- provide robust and memory safe data structures with tests
- provide a good balance of performance and memory efficiency
- provide some more obscure data structures not in standard libraries
  - 2d or 3d arrays
  - triangular 2d arrays
  - binary heap with element lookup
  - graphs (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
- provide type generic algorithm code for copy and pasting
